### Hi, I’m Paige! 🧙‍♀️

**I'm a programmer, [Lighthouse Labs grad](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/), and avid puzzle-solver.**

🌱 &nbsp;I'm currently honing my React skills, exploring UX design, and learning how to use Lottie.  
🐙 &nbsp;I have a background in motion design and illustration.  
👀 &nbsp;Typescript and creating interactive elements with html canvas are currently on my radar.  
🍄 &nbsp;When I'm not coding I'm reading medieval historical fiction, gaming, or exploring nature.
